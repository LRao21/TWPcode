                <p>Hello! I am <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/lavanya-rao-512988290/"> <strong>Lavanya (she/her).</strong></a>
                    I am studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at Rutgers University. 
                    After Rutgers, I want to get a master's in cybersecurity or enter the workforce directly. 
                    Wherever I end up, I hope I'll be able to go with the flow. </p>
                <p> Hopefully, along the way, I also build some more fun things! 
                    Whenever I get a chance, I like to play Minecraft and design parts of buildings, or catch up on some old shows I love and explore new ones. 
                    Recently, I binged <em>The Good Place</em> and <em>A Man on the Inside</em>. 
                    I also played <em>Chants of Sennaar</em> enough times to gain every achievement and understand all of the languages throughout its plot. </p>
                <p> I love a good narrative. 
                    Moreso, I love a good narrative about little things: the things one does not always think about, the little joys, the smaller parts of our lifestyles that can make us come together or fall apart. 
                    In details lie thought.</p>
                <p>Computer Science is a way for me to build those narratives into something interactive and visual; 
                    I like to add some level of plot or complexity to my projects to make creating things more interactive and filling! 
                    I already plan to incorporate some of the storytelling elements and overall feel of my recent shows and gaming experiences into my projects.</p>
